**There is a DB change, sync protocol remains unchanged. Make a full backup of the app before upgrading because the data directory is not included in the pre-upgrade backup script.**

This version switches upstream from legacy Trilium to TriliumNext, the continuation/maintained fork. Please **make full backup of the app prior this upgrade** as pre-upgrade backups **will not** restore properly.

#### _Release Notes_
See [release notes](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/releases/tag/v0.96.0) for more information.
